**COCO 2017: Common Objects in Context 2017** is a dataset for instance segmentation, semantic segmentation, and object detection tasks. It is applicable or relevant across various domains. 

The dataset consists of 163957 images with 2099063 labeled objects belonging to 80 different classes including *person*, *chair*, *car*, and other: *dining table*, *cup*, *bottle*, *bowl*, *handbag*, *truck*, *bench*, *backpack*, *book*, *cell phone*, *sink*, *clock*, *tv*, *potted plant*, *couch*, *dog*, *knife*, *sports ball*, *traffic light*, *cat*, *umbrella*, *bus*, *tie*, *bed*, *train*, and 52 more.

Images in the COCO 2017 dataset have pixel-level instance segmentation and bounding box annotations. Due to the nature of the instance segmentation task, it can be automatically transformed into a semantic segmentation task (only one mask for every class). There are 41739 (25% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *train2017* (118287 images), *test2017* (40670 images), and *val2017* (5000 images). The dataset was released in 2017 by the <span style="font-weight: 600; color: grey; border-bottom: 1px dashed #d3d3d3;">COCO Consortium</span>.

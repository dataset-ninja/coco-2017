Following dataset is a part of a large **Microsoft COCO** dataset. Check dataset's [homepage](https://cocodataset.org/#home) for more info. 

Authors present Microsoft COCO with the goal of advancing the state-of-the-art in object recognition by placing the question of object recognition in the context of the broader question of scene understanding. This is achieved by gathering images of complex everyday scenes containing common objects in their natural context. Microsoft COCO dataset contains photos of 91 objects types that would be easily recognizable by a 4 year old. With a total of *2.5 million labeled instances in 328k images*. 

The dataset addresses three core research problems in scene understanding: detecting non-iconic views (or non-canonical perspectives [[12](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10602-1_48#Bib1)]) of objects, contextual reasoning between objects and the precise 2D localization of objects he selection of object categories is a non-trivial exercise. The categories must form a representative set of all categories, be relevant to practical applications and occur with high enough frequency to enable the collection of a large dataset. 

Other important decisions are whether to include both “thing” and “stuff” categories [[39](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-88682-2_4)] and whether fine-grained [[31](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10602-1_48#Bib1)], [[1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10602-1_48#Bib1)] and object-part categories should be included. “Thing” categories include objects for which individual instances may be easily labeled (person, chair, car) where “stuff” categories include materials and objects with no clear boundaries (sky, street, grass). Since we are primarily interested in precise localization of object instances, we decided to only include “thing” categories and not “stuff.” However, since “stuff” categories can provide significant contextual information, we believe the future labeling of “stuff” categories would be beneficial. 

The specificity of object categories can vary significantly. For instance, a dog could be a member of the “mammal”, “dog”, or “German shepherd” categories. To enable the practical collection of a significant number of instances per category, we chose to limit our dataset to entry-level categories, i.e. category labels that are commonly used by humans when describing objects (dog, chair, person). It is also possible that some object categories may be parts of other object categories. For instance, a face may be part of a person. We anticipate the inclusion of object-part categories (face, hands, wheels) would be beneficial for many real-world application.
